# Pathfinder

This is Pathfinder.
There are two subdivisions of it.One with single source and single destination points and another with single source and multiple destinations point(Travelling salesman Problem).

Branch:
1.master:It contains the basic implementation of A* algo,the source and destination are fixed now.
2.DJ:It contains the Implementation of Djikstra Algo,again in this source and destinations are fixed now.
3.complete:This is the complete implementation of A* algo,with mouse functions,buttons working.Also Travelling Salesman implementation can be visulazed here.Just replace the sketch.js file with tsp.js.

Currently,working on it.That's why it's completely mess there in the code!!!.
